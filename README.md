# Assignment2_Sequence-Machine-Compiler

 - SMC stands for Sequence Machine Compiler.
 - Instructions may be found inside of the starter code file called "smc.cpp".
 - Public unit tests are baked into the starter code file.
 - The specification for the SMC is inside of the PDF file.
 - You can download this assignment either by clicking on code >> download ZIP or by typeing the following command into your command prompt on your computer, assuming git is installed:

 git clone https://github.com/NVCC-ITP-132-BWS/Assignment2_Sequence-Machine-Compiler.git


 - If things go south or updates become availible, you will be able to 'pull' them from this github location. Consider installing git on your machine.

 - DO NOT modify smc.cpp line 1 - 1900. I will replace the first 1900 lines of your program with my own when I evaluated your work.

# Running smc.cpp

- To run your code, either copy its contents into an online ide like onlinegdb or create a project in an offline ide and add the smc.cpp file to it.

 - You can run the reference solution located inside of the reference solution executable folder. You can use it to see what my personal solution to this assignment outputs when its run on the input.txt file located inside of the IN folder.

 - The reference solution may not work outside of a windows machine. Let me know if you want it to work in other operating systems and I can see what I can do.

 - Everything is in its proper folder right now.


Good Luck


- BUG notes: On Online GDB, the xecuting the example prints replacement characters at the end of the file and on my machine prints [\n] text instead of the line numbers. This doesn't happen on my windows machine.
- I may have failed to check for failure conditions in some of the earlier code that I wrote. It shouldn't affect your experience unless you are very ambitious.
